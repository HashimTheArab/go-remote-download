# Go Remote Downloader

This repository contains a Go program that allows you to download the latest version of a file (`gophertunnel.exe`) from a remote source and run it.
The program provides a simple interface to download the latest version and run it.

## Features

- **Download Latest Version**: Press `d` to download the latest version from the specified URL.
- **Run the File**: Press `r` to run the downloaded file.

## Usage
